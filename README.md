## VBA Tutorials

VBA is the go to tool to help automate Office applications and take reptitive tasks and turn them into simple macros that save time and effort. The VBA object model is used across multiple applications and contains 100s of objects that can be controlled and manipulated. This section was intended for users who want to take a deep dive into VBA and explore not just Excel VBA but the other Office Applications. At this point, we currently have code for the following applications.

* **[Excel VBA](https://github.com/areed1192/sigma_coding_youtube/tree/master/vba/excel-vba)** Explore the core concepts neeed to master Excel VBA. Along with this, take a deep dive into the different object heiarchies like Ranges, Pivot Tables, and Power Pivot.

* **[Word VBA](https://github.com/areed1192/sigma_coding_youtube/tree/master/vba/word-vba)** Explore how to manipulate and modify Word documents using VBA. Word documents are great for documenting a wide arrange of information, make VBA your friend and see how to format these documents uing VBA.

* **[PowerPoint VBA](https://github.com/areed1192/sigma_coding_youtube/tree/master/vba/powerpoint-vba)** PowerPoint is the go to presentation creator for any company, but help save time by exploring how to control links, shapes and other PowerPoint objects at your disposal.

## Python Tutorials

Python is a powerful program language that is easy to use and learn, many who want to learn programming start with Python. In my tutorials, I am currently focusing on how to use Python the VBA object model. This opens up a whole host of new capabilities that we can now take advantage of.

* **[Python VBA](https://github.com/areed1192/sigma_coding_youtube/tree/master/python/python-vba)** The Win32 library is a powerful library that allows for quick access into different Window objects. Unfortunately, documentation is hard to come by and when it is found it's hard to follow or difficult to apply it to your case. I wanted to make this easier for everyone by making tutorials and walking through the important steps to help grasp the fundamental concepts.

* **[Python APIs](https://github.com/areed1192/sigma_coding_youtube/tree/master/python/python-apis)** APIs are an easy and standardized way to access information across different companies. Let's explore how to use popular APIs to capture valuable pieces of data.

<td>Q# language and compiler</td>
<td>Q# is a domain-specific programming language used for expressing quantum algorithms. It is used for writing sub-programs that execute on an adjunct quantum processor under the control of a classical host program and computer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Q# library</td>
<td>The library contains operations and functions that support both the classical language control requirement and the Q# quantum algorithms.</td>

<td>Local quantum machine simulator</td>
<td>A full state vector simulator optimized for accurate vector simulation and speed.</td>

<tr>
<td>Quantum computer trace simulator</td>
<td>The trace simulator does not simulate the quantum environment like the local quantum simulator. It is used to estimate the resources required to execute a quantum program and also allow faster debugging of the non-Q# control code.</td>

<td>Resource Estimator</td>
<td>The resource estimator estimates the resources required to run a given instance of a Q# operation on a quantum computer.</td>
