From here, we can filter all of their documents to the ones that meet our criteria.\n",

If you search for a company name, you can get back more than one company back.\n",

    ">- **type**: (optional) Allows filtering the type of form. For example, if set to 10-k only the 10-K filings are returned.\n",
    ">- **dateb**: (optional) Will only return the filings before a given date. The format is as follows YYYYMMDD\n",
    ">- **owner**: (required) Is set to `exclude` by default and specifies ownership. You may also set it to `include` and `only`.\n",
    ">- **start**: (optional) Is the starting index of the results. For example, if I have 100 results but want to start at 45 of 100, I would pass 45.\n",
    ">- **count**: (optional) The number of results you want to see with your request, the max is 100 and if not set it will default to 40.\n",
